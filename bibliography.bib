   abstract = {With this text, you gain an understanding of the fundamental concepts of algorithms, the very heart of computer science. It introduces the basic data structures and programming techniques often used in efficient algorithms. Covers use of lists, pushdown stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. Later chapters go into sorting, searching and graphing algorithms, the stringmatching algorithms, and the Schonhage-Strassen integer multiplication algorithm. Provides numerous graded exercises at the end of each chapter.},

   abstract = {In the first part of the paper, we reexamine the all-pairsshortest paths (APSP) problem and present a newalgorithm with running time approaching O(n3/log2n), which improves all known algorithms for general real-weighted dense graphs andis perhaps close to the best result possible without using fast matrix multiplication, modulo a few log log n factors. In the second part of the paper, we use fast matrix multiplication to obtain truly subcubic APSP algorithms for a large class of "geometrically weighted" graphs, where the weight of an edge is a function of the coordinates of its vertices. For example, for graphs embedded in Euclidean space of a constant dimension d, we obtain a time bound near O(n3-(3-Ω)/(2d+4)), where Ω < 2.376 ; in two dimensions, this is O(n2.922). Our framework greatly extends the previously considered case of small-integer-weighted graphs, and incidentally also yields the first truly subcubic result (near O(n3-(3-Ω)/4)=O(n2.844) time) forAPSP in real-vertex-weighted graphs, as well as an improved result (near O(n(3+Ω)/2)=O(n2.688) time) for the all-pairs lightest shortest path problem for small-integer-weighted graphs.},

upper bounds on these recurrences, by using a suitable weight function to
reduce the problem to that of solving univariate linear recurrences; show how
to use quasiconvex programming to determine the weight function yielding the
smallest upper bound; and prove that the resulting upper bounds are within a
polynomial factor of the true asymptotics of the recurrence. We develop and
implement a multiple-gradient descent algorithm for the resulting quasiconvex
programs, using a real-number arithmetic package for guaranteed accuracy of the
computed worst case time bounds.},
