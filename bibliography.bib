   abstract = {In the first part of the paper, we reexamine the all-pairsshortest paths (APSP) problem and present a newalgorithm with running time approaching O(n3/log2n), which improves all known algorithms for general real-weighted dense graphs andis perhaps close to the best result possible without using fast matrix multiplication, modulo a few log log n factors. In the second part of the paper, we use fast matrix multiplication to obtain truly subcubic APSP algorithms for a large class of "geometrically weighted" graphs, where the weight of an edge is a function of the coordinates of its vertices. For example, for graphs embedded in Euclidean space of a constant dimension d, we obtain a time bound near O(n3-(3-Ω)/(2d+4)), where Ω < 2.376 ; in two dimensions, this is O(n2.922). Our framework greatly extends the previously considered case of small-integer-weighted graphs, and incidentally also yields the first truly subcubic result (near O(n3-(3-Ω)/4)=O(n2.844) time) forAPSP in real-vertex-weighted graphs, as well as an improved result (near O(n(3+Ω)/2)=O(n2.688) time) for the all-pairs lightest shortest path problem for small-integer-weighted graphs.},

@article{Chen2022,
   abstract = {We revisit the problem of privately releasing the all-pairs shortest path
distances of a weighted undirected graph up to low additive error, which was
first studied by Sealfon [Sea16]. In this paper, we improve significantly on
Sealfon's results, both for arbitrary weighted graphs and for bounded-weight
graphs on $n$ nodes. Specifically, we provide an approximate-DP algorithm that
outputs all-pairs shortest path distances up to maximum additive error
$\tilde\{O\}(\sqrt\{n\})$, and a pure-DP algorithm that outputs all pairs shortest
path distances up to maximum additive error $\tilde\{O\}(n^\{2/3\})$ (where we
ignore dependencies on $\varepsilon, \delta$). This improves over the previous
best result of $\tilde\{O\}(n)$ additive error for both approximate-DP and
pure-DP [Sea16], and partially resolves an open question posed by Sealfon
[Sea16, Sea20]. We also show that if the graph is promised to have reasonably
bounded weights, one can improve the error further to roughly
$n^\{\sqrt\{2\}-1+o(1)\}$ in the approximate-DP setting and roughly
$n^\{(\sqrt\{17\}-3)/2 + o(1)\}$ in the pure-DP setting. Previously, it was only
known how to obtain $\tilde\{O\}(n^\{1/2\})$ additive error in the approximate-DP
setting and $\tilde\{O\}(n^\{2/3\})$ additive error in the pure-DP setting for
bounded-weight graphs [Sea16].},

@article{Cooper2022,
   abstract = {The idea that quantum effects could be harnessed to allow faster computation was first proposed by Feynman. As of 2020 we appear to have achieved 'quantum supremacy', that is, a quantum computer that performs a given task faster than its classical counterpart. This paper examines some possibilities opened up by potential future application of quantum computing to transportation simulation and planning. To date, no such research was found to exist, therefore we begin with an introduction to quantum computing for the programmers of transport models. We discuss existing quantum computing research relevant to transportation, finding developments in network analysis, shortest path computation, multi-objective routing, optimization and calibration - of which the latter three appear to offer the greater promise in future research. Two examples are developed in greater detail, (1) an application of Grover's quantum algorithm for extracting the mean, which has general applicability towards summarizing distributions which are expensive to compute classically, is applied to an assignment or betweenness model - quantum speedup is elusive in the general case but achievable when trading speed for accuracy for limited outputs; (2) quantum optimization is applied to an activity-based model, giving a theoretically quadratic speedup. Recent developments notwithstanding, implementation of quantum transportation algorithms will for the foreseeable future remain a challenge due to space overheads imposed by the requirement for reversible computation.},

@article{Yuster2009,
   abstract = {Sets of permutations play an important role in the design of some efficient algorithms. In this paper we design two algorithms that manipulate sets of permutations. Both algorithms, each solving a different problem, use fast matrix multiplication techniques to achieve a significant improvement in the running time over the naive solutions. For a set of permutations P ⊂ Sn we say that i k-dominates j if the number of permutations π ∈ P for which π(i) < π(j) is k. The dominance matrix of P is the n x n matrix DP where DP(i, j) = k if and only if i k-dominates j. We give an efficient algorithm for computing Dp using fast rectangular matrix multiplication. In particular, when |P| = n our algorithm runs in O(n 2.684) time. Computing the dominance matrix of permutations is computationally equivalent to the dominance problem in computational geometry. Thus, our algorithm slightly improves upon a well-known O(n2.688) time algorithm of Matousek for the dominance problem. Permutation dominance is used, together with several other ingredients, to obtain a truly sub-cubic algorithm for the All Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP) problem in real-weighted directed graphs, where the number of distinct weights emanating from each vertex is O(n0.338). A special case of this algorithm implies an O(n 2.842) time algorithm for real vertex-weighted APSP, which slightly improves a recent result of Chan [STOC-07]. A set of permutations P ⊂ S n is fully expanding if the product of any two elements of P yields a distinct permutation. Stated otherwise, |P2| = |P|2 where P2 ⊂ Sn is the set of products of two elements of P. We present a randomized algorithm that computes |P2| and hence decides if P is fully expanding. The algorithm also produces a table that, for any σ1, σ2, σ3, σ4 ∈ P, answers the query σ1σ 2 = σ3σ4 in Õ(1) time. The algorithm uses, among other ingredients, a combination of fast matrix multiplication and polynomial identity testing. In particular, for |P| = n our algorithm runs in O(nω) time where ω < 2.376 is the matrix multiplication exponent. We note that the naive deterministic solution for this problem requires Θ(n3) time.
