\chapter{Summary}\label{chap:summary}

During the preceding chapters we have seen how to achieve a solution to APSPPs in $\mathcal{O}\left( \frac{n^3}{\log(n)} \right)$ time by considering first a problem in Computational Geometry and later circling back to distance products and APSPPs.
This result presents but one point in a long series of algorithmic improvements.
Previous works have already been showcased in the introductory part of this manuscript.
What is left is the question of advances made after the~\cite{Chan2007} paper.
During the research for this seminar, there were mainly two directly related works for solving APSPPs.

First off, there is~\cite{Han2008}.
In this publication, a bound of $\mathcal{O}\left( n^3 {\frac{\log^{\frac{5}{4}}(\log(n))}{\log^{\frac{5}{4}}(n)}} \right)$ is obtained.
The author deviates from the approach described in this manuscript in two significant ways:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item %
        The matrices for which the distance product is computed are split in both matrix dimensions.
        In contrast, the procedure described in~\cite{Chan2007} only split the matrix in one matrix dimension, yielding ``longer'' rectangular matrix blocks when compared to~\cite{Han2008}.
    \item %
        Instead of appropriate index sets and their relation to dominating pairs, a lookup table is computed before assembling the final distance product.
        This approach in particular may be more illustrative compared to the set method when trying to realize the final reduction, but as tradeoff lacks the underlying geometric connection.
\end{enumerate}
Within this paper it is pointed out that further improvements employing tabulation and bit-parallelism could be hard to come by, cf.~\cite[Section~6]{Han2008}.

Secondly, there is a follow-up result in~\cite{Chan2010}.
This is noticable in the fact that the author once more uses ``long'' rectangular matrix blocks, but replaces the geometric subproblem of computing dominating pairs by thinking in terms of \emph{cuttings}.
Proceeding thusly, the distance product is actually computed in subquadratic time by operating on compressed lists and matrices to reduce word size and word count.
In addition to the theoretical result,\ \cite[Table~1.1]{Chan2010} contains a nice display of the runtime progression, which begins with Dijkstra and Floyd-Warshal in the late 1950s and early 1960s, and ends at in 2007 with~\cite{Chan2010}.
In the conclusion, there is also mention of~\cite{Yuster2009}, which improves the runtime from $\mathcal{O}\left( n^{2.844} \right)$ to $\mathcal{O}\left( n^{2.842} \right)$.

All in all, the progress made since the Floyd-Warshall algorithm has been both slow, and few and far between.
Evolution of methods has essentially boiled down to exchanging small parts of procedures or obtaining slightly better bounds on known results.
Applications of these results, and relaxations to other similar problems, have however been been used in fields such as Shortest Paths Problems with Differential Privacy~\cite{Chen2022}, or even far off areas such as Quantum Computing in Transportation Modelling~\cite{Cooper2022}.
With the importance of APSPPs in Graph Theory and real world problems it is unlikely the desire for even better algorithms will cease soon.
