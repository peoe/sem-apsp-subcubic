@book{Aho1974,
   abstract = {With this text, you gain an understanding of the fundamental concepts of algorithms, the very heart of computer science. It introduces the basic data structures and programming techniques often used in efficient algorithms. Covers use of lists, pushdown stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. Later chapters go into sorting, searching and graphing algorithms, the stringmatching algorithms, and the Schonhage-Strassen integer multiplication algorithm. Provides numerous graded exercises at the end of each chapter.},

The new algorithm is surprisingly simple and different from previous ones.},
